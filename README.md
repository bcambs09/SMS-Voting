# SMS Voting Application

***Disclaimer***
This app is based largely on the code from a Twilio Blog tutorial (https://www.twilio.com/blog/2012/09/building-a-real-time-sms-voting-app-part-1-node-js-couchdb.html). The code was adapted to fit my needs.

SMS Voting Application was designed to be used for a beauty pageant voting system. The audience can send in votes to decide who advances to subsequent rounds.

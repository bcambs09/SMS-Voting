# Building a Real-time SMS Voting App Part 1: Node.js & CouchDB


**DISCLAIMER**: The code in this repo is for educational purposes and is pretty poor/unoptimized code. This is the first in a 5-part series and the code improves greatly over that span. If you want to learn, start here and work your way through all the changes and tweaks to the codebase.If you're looking for a more polished and performant app for SMS voting, please [skip ahead to the codebase in part 5][2]. 

-------------

This app is part of the [first blog post][1] in a four-part series on building an SMS and voice voting application using Node.js. This app demostrates the basics of:

* Using Express to create a new app
* Configuring a CouchDB
* Creating a new route to process votes
* Connecting Twilio to this route
